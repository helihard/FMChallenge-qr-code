## Overview

I had a clear image from the get-go of how to accomplish the layout and styling. I figured that coding the designs for mobile vs desktop would be pretty straight forward, but found they still required some problem solving.

## My process

- reading up on mobile-first workflow
- planning
- basic html structure
- basic CSS styling
- text styling
- mobile vs desktop adjustments and problem solving
- finishing touches


### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- flexbox
- mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

More insight into mobile-first workflow. When I first started coding, it was early days for smartphones (early 2000s) and I have just recently started getting into code again. There is much to catch up on â€“ exciting!

I am generally more in favour of relative length units, but in this challenge I found absolute lenght unit px easier to work with.


### Continued development

In future projects, I want to continue focusing on

- mobile-first workflow 
- responsive design in general
- accessible design
- flexbox (still more confident using grid)
- getting more familiar with git (still early days - apparently, I did not successfully commit at all stages of the process)
- learning calc()
